COOKIE
When posts first load, it does a SSR request, and the cookie is not sent so it doesn't know who we are.
When you click load more, it's making a request from the browser straight to the GQL api and now has session cookie
ssr
    browser -> next.js -> graphql API
client side
    browser -> graphql API

ADDING COOKIE TO RETURN OBJECT IN URQL CLIENT
Browser will send cookie to NextJS server and NextJS will include them in header to the GraphQL API
When GraphQL API has cookie, it can tell whether you voted or not

You can know if your user is authenticated or not when doing SSR when using cookies
